That's project I use platform io to code. It's have the same features like Arduino, but faster compile, easy to find and fix bug, more feature to use with lib.
The code combine Alexa and Google Assistant, you can use your voice to control relay. More specific, I will make a video to explain more about it
In this project I use adafruit and sinric to combine 2 assistant. That's quite difficult but the result is great. You can use only sinric but some problem happend with Google Assistant, I can't create the application link my relay with Google Assistant, so I can't use it. Maybe the furture the errors can fix. Or you can use new version of Sinric is Sinric Pro, that's really fast, I tested it.
