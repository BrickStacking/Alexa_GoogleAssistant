# Alexa_GoogleAssistant
Using Esp8266 (Board Node MCU) to control 4 relay, can using app or button in board to control.

The code combine Alexa and Google Assistant, you can use your voice to control relay. More specific, I will make a video to explain more about it

In this project I use adafruit and sinric to combine 2 assistant. That's quite difficult but the result is great. You can use only sinric but some problem happend with Google Assistant, I can't create the application link my relay with Google Assistant, so I can't use it. Maybe the furture the errors can fix. Or you can use new version of Sinric is Sinric Pro, that's really fast, I tested it.
